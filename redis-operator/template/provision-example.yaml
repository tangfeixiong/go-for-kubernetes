    #    if only one slaves, hash slots must be 16384
    #    in multiple slaves, when hash slots value is 0, means auto data sharding, for example:
    #        for 6 nodes with 3 masters and 3 slaves, the slots are sharding as 0-5500, 5501-11000, 11001-16383
    #    for non-zero value, it is firstly meet 1st slave, then 2nd slave, and 3rd...
